# Project1-Team3
The object of this challenge was to choose a topic we found interesting, find data on that topic, and utilize everything we learned in class to clean the data. Additionally, we aimed to answer questions we came up with to analyze the data and create visualizations for presentation to the class. This marked our inaugural group project, with our team being Team 3, consisting of 3 students.

We selected the dataset titled "Gun Deaths in America," not only due to our interest in the topic but also because one group member had a background in criminal justice, another had a finance background and sought to explore beyond her comfort zone, and the third had recently experienced a disagreement with her significant other after discovering his ownership of multiple guns. It proved to be the perfect topic at the right time.

The data told a compelling story and challenged prevailing beliefs. To preserve the integrity of the narrative, we exercised caution in cleaning the data, removing only one category that was unrelated to our line of questioning. Specifically, we excluded a "police category" indicating whether or not the police were present during the crime. Additionally, we eliminated missing data in the age and education columns.

The repository for this project includes:

Output folder: Contains png files with screenshots of the chart summarizations

Resources folder: Contains a csv file "gun_deaths" and it is the data source

Python Script File titled: "Merged_Guns_in_America" which contains graphs and analysis

Lastly, the repository contains this README file
